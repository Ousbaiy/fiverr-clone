# Fiverr Clone

This is a web application that mimics the features and design of the popular freelance marketplace platform, Fiverr. It has been built using React, Sass, React Slick, and Vite.

## Getting Started
To get started with the project, first, clone the repository to your local machine. Then, navigate to the project directory and run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/Ousbaiy/fiverr-clone.git
```
2. Install the dependencies:

```
cd fiverr-clone
npm install
```
3. Start the development server:

```
npm run dev
```
This will start the development server and open the app in your default browser. The app will automatically reload whenever you make changes to the code.


## Features

The application includes several key features that replicate the functionality of Fiverr. These include:

- A landing page that displays featured gigs and categories.
- A search bar that allows users to search for gigs based on keywords.
- A gig detail page that displays information about a specific gig, including its title, price, and description.
- A user dashboard where users can manage their gigs, view their orders, and messages.
- A register page

## Technologies Used

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/): A lightweight, fast, and opinionated web development build tool.
- [React](https://reactjs.org/): A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/): A preprocessor scripting language that is interpreted into Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).
- [React-slick](https://react-slick.neostack.com/): A carousel component for React.
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/): A static code analysis tool for identifying problematic patterns found in JavaScript code.


These technologies were chosen for their efficiency, simplicity, and popularity within the web development community. Vite was chosen as the build tool due to its speed and ease of use, while React was chosen for its robustness and flexibility in building complex user interfaces. SASS was used for its ability to simplify and streamline the process of writing and managing CSS, while React Slick was chosen for its versatility in creating carousels and sliders.
